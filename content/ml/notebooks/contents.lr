intro:

### Expository notebooks

Here are a collection of [Jupyter iPython](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks I've created to solidify my understanding of ideas during my studies of probability, stats and machine learning.

### Kaggle notebooks

I've attempted a few [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) competitions, here are the relevant notebooks:
- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
  - [Attempt 1](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/krosaen/ml-study/blob/master/kaggle/titanic/titanic.ipynb): quick and dirty first attempt with a few models
  - [Attempt 2](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/krosaen/ml-study/blob/master/kaggle/titanic2/titanic2.ipynb): more exploration, feature engineering
- [Forest Cover Type Prediction](http://kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction)
  - [Attempt 1](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/krosaen/ml-study/blob/master/kaggle/forest-cover-type-prediction/forest-cover-type-prediction.ipynb): quick and dirty first attempt with a few models, also using PCA
  - [Attempt 2](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/krosaen/ml-study/blob/master/kaggle/forest-cover-type-prediction2/forest-cover-type-prediction2.ipynb): pipelines, deeper performance analysis with k-fold cross validation and learning curves, hyperparameter tuning
